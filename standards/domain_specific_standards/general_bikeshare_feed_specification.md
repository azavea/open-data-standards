## Background
The General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) was developed in 2015 based on an initial specification developed by Mitch Vars. The specification is primarily aimed at use by end users of bikeshare systems, and it therefore focuses on read-only, real-time or near real-time data on bike availability. As such, it is not designed to provide historical or archival data on trips or system usage.


## Analysis

Led by NABSA members, GBFS has seen extremely broad adoption with hundreds of bikeshare programs.
